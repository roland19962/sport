<!-- This is a basic example chunk for getFolders when used with getImages. 
The tags it uses are:
+fpath - The placeholder for the path to the folder.
+folder - The placeholder for the folder name.
Make sure the document ID (2) is changed to the ID of your document.

<a href="[[~2?&folder=`[[+fpath]]`]]"  title="[[+folder]] Photos">[[+folder]] Photos</a>
