<!-- This is an example chunk for getImages to display an image with some basic styling.  
The tags it uses are:
+class - A placeholder to add a class to your div for styling. defaults to ""
+imgLink - The placeholder for the image link.
By using the great pThumb snippit by jgrant I am able to have the page display thumbnails from a cache 
that it creates on the fly. The link still points to the full size image. (see pThumb documentation for usage)
-->

<div class="[[+class]]">
<a href="[[+imgLink]]" target="_blank">
<img src="[[+imgLink:pThumb=`w=250&h=188&f=png&bg=00f&far=BC&zc=1`]]" alt="[[+imgLink]]" />
</a>
</div>
