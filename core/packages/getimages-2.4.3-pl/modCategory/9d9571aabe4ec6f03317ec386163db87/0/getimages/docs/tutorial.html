getImages

Step by step instructions for setting up a gallery from your own file structure.

	After downloading and installing with package management you should have the snippets
getImages, monthName, getPage, getFolders, getFoldersList, and pThumbs as well as several example
template chunks. First you will need 4 template chunks. To get started just duplicate the
example_getImages_Child_Tpl, example_getImages_Parent_Tpl, example_getImages_Page_Tpl, and
example_getImages_Image_Tpl and remove the "Duplicate of example_" part. If you plan on having 
the snippet pull the folder from the URL you must uncomment the first "$folder" line under 
/***** SET VARIABLES *****/
in the snippet and comment out the second. After you have played with it a bit you will want to 
modify the templates to suit your needs. Take a look at the other example template chunks for ideas on 
what can be done. By my naming the supplied chunks with the example prefix it allows you to update 
the snippet without writing over your modifications. Next you will need to create 2 documents, 
one to act as a menu and the other to show the images. Lets call them ImagesMenu and ImagesPage 
(you may of course name them as you see fit). 

In the ImagesMenu document place a call to the getFolders snippet. Be sure to include the 
getFolders_path if you have placed your images anywhere other than in assets. This will parse 
the folder structure for you. Also add a call to getFoldersList to display the menu.

EXAMPLE:
[[!getFolders?
&getFolders_path=`assets/photos`
]]

<xmp><div class="menu">
<ul>
[[!getFoldersList?
&tplChild=`getImages_Child_Tpl`
&tplParent=`getImages_Parent_Tpl`
]]
</ul>
</div></xmp>

You will notice that I am changing the child and parent templates to the ones made for 
getImages and wrapping the call in <ul></ul> to complete the menu list. I use a menu css 
style to make the unordered list appear as a dropdown menu but you can style it as you like. 
This page should now show a list of all folders under your supplied path and each should link 
to the ImagesPage document with ?folder=<the path to the folder> appended. For this to work 
correctly you must change the getImages_Child_Tpl so that the link has the document ID of the 
ImagesPage you created. In the example template chunk it is set to document id 2. Just change 
the 2 to the ID of yours.

In the ImagesPage document place the getImages snippet.

EXAMPLE:
[[!getImages]]

Or place the getPage snippet with a getImages call. This will allow you to determine how many
Images you would like per page (Add the limit & pageLimit parameters and +page.nav section to 
show the navigation links - see getPage documentation)
 
EXAMPLE with getPage:
[[!getPage?
&elementClass=`modSnippet`
&element=`getImages`
&limit=`4`
&pageLimit=`3`
]]

[[!+page.nav]]


EXAMPLE with more parameters:
[[!getPage?
&elementClass=`modSnippet`
&element=`getImages`
&getImages_Image_Tpl=`getImages_PhotosModel_Tpl`
&getImages_Page_Tpl=`getImages_Page_Tpl`
&getImages_Ext =`jpg,gif,png,JPG,GIF,PNG`
&getImages_Paging=`1`
&getImages_Random=`1`
&getImages_Class=`grid-img`
&getImages_PageClass=`row`
&getImages_InfoClass=`info`
&getImages_ExifClass=`exif`
&getImages_Width=`250`
&getImages_Height=`188`
&limit=`10`
&pageLimit=`3`
]]

This snippet will use the template chunks to place each image on the page. If using getPage 
and if there are more images than will fit on the page (limit), more pages will be made by 
getPage.

This should get you going and as always I would be grateful for any and all suggestions for 
improvements. Support/Comments should be posted here:
